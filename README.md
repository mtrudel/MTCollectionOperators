# MTCollectionOperators

A simple collection of helper methods added to NSSet and NSArray to do inline
intersection, subtraction, and mapping.

## Usage

Usage is straightforward; see the header files for method details.

## Requirements

MTCollectionOperators should work on any version of iOS or OS X that supports
ARC. If non-ARC is required, let me know and I'll make this pod non-ARC
friendly.
